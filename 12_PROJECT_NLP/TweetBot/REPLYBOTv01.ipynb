how long agoi mean how long has it been there ermnearly twelve years i think nowno mustmust be more than that ahhave to get a pair of scissors  what brought you to this part when youwent back to well largely because we couldn't afford a house in the area where we both grew up where was that the south east london oh yeahoh right at least i was born in kent but er brought up in south east london oh yeahwhere thewhereabouts ermborn in welling and er and thenthen we moved to lewisham mmmm  ermthat was immediately after the waryou knowthe first war right  did your erm wife come from the same area wellin a wayalthough her parents were scotch oh  her mother's family from st andrews and her father from dundee oh  but they moved out of london long before  ermoh he came to london to get work yeah yeah  and what made you choose this particular part of well oneone of my sons is married to ergir girl whose family live in buckley ohoh  and er  originally whenwhen we first sought to retiringretiringwe were attracted to the dalesbut we couldn't afford that no  no this is the great problem of er  at the momentoh it was c w m when you retired wasn't it mm and erm  and did theyhad they got their nanny form of assistance they had but it was ermmuch less satisfactory as a u r c one mm but they've changed nowthey're more or less on the same basis as the u r c oh but erm  it didn't look a very attractive proposition at the time oh for one thingif we'd taken one of their houses and i'd died firstmy wife would of been left without a home oh dear except for going to the eryou knowthey've got that place in worthing erm  yeah  erm yeah levers house yeah but we wereneither of us very keen on that no not reallyno  could you of chosen  erm  where to have the house or did they

that time property was fairly cheap in bradley mmmm we got this for seven and a half thousand ohblimeymm i think it cost more than that now oh i think soyeah  you wouldn't purchase the land that it stands on for that now  mind you it's only a paper profit because you can't rely on it nono  where are you from originally ah londoneast londoneast ham  actually i was brought up till i was about

far from where we live really mmmm  and i often tell people that erthose who don't come from london don't realise  the difference between north and south mm south london they're two different worlds

gradually reduced to tworight at the end we were getting every two years yesthat's rightyeah but that didn't happen very often to us because it was just being introduced  that's right yeahyeah  yes our first tour was fiveit was supposed to be fourbutwe ermer for some reason or other we didn't really want to come homeha fourso we stretched to three well we had one more tour after thatermbut the  and would really of referred to of stayedmade the next tour longer than two mm but errules are rules aren't they it seems  ioh i seemed to feel that itit wasif we wanted to see three it was gonna upsetwell they seemed thati thought it would save money if they mm but we stayed home thenyeah  i'm not quite sure where you did go zambia ah i had been into zambiabut not very often  oh in fact when i was stationed in mule i used to travel through zambia to get to one of my out stations oh did you simply because the roads were better that sidewhen it was northern rhodesia you crossed on the pontoon did you yes and then came back over the bridge o over the falls bridge oh we did that a few times when thethe borders were closed with came across pontoon throughof course it's a much more e elaborate pontoon now then it was then i'm sure that was er oh it wasn't very elaborate well you could get oneone and a half ton truck on it  and it was driven across with a couple of engines i can't remember of it the others with athe engine midway i know they did put in er aa much better ferry they  oh yeah yeah and then of course the americans paid for that road up to  mmthat's rightyeah but erwhich really was a waste of money it waswell it's used a bit for tourism now mmmm  but it's but commercially it was of no importance no  but it was er part of the sanctions policy against rhodesia yeah that's right  where were you inin zambia ermi waswe was all the time we were therein er ah the theological college mm erthe only time i really went any distance was erwelli went with er paul  to  oh yeah it was erat a time when this an african district committee sent representatives to the central and visa versa ohoh  mm  that must of been some time ago yes nineteen fifty something i think  ermof course the economic out in zambia the economic situations is disastrous now  and the drought of course has made it worse pardon the drought  the drought yeahyeah  just now the drought seems to be much more widespread now doesn't it and er into south africa well i was looking at the er very bad erm  and they were saying that ersouth africa's going to have to import food this year  that's rightyeah  normallysouth africa feeds these other countries northfurther south inin bad years mmmm yes south africa has ermererwe have a regular erm a four sheet twotwo sides of a four sheeterm it was weeklybut it's erm a fortnightly mm newsletter now it's just a news sheet fromof zambia mm erit's pretty youthful this country with it's zambian ercall it zambian newspa newspapers so it's very liable as to whatyou know it's no comm it's not comment at allit's justand erm the last one two weeks ago i think it wasindicated that erm south africa's production of maize would beoh i can't rememberbut a lot short of what they require themselves  yeahohit's down to about a quarter of normal it is  a quarter is it as low as that because there are worries that it's going to ereffect the outcome of this mad ref referendumyou know they the farmers are sort of desperate and they think they need government help and they think they wouldn't get it because of the black government  so but ermbotswana's ermdoing quite well oh yeswell you see they've got the names yes that's rightbut ermunfortunately zambia's the copperhas had the copper and mm the copper erm  and of courseernormal years they also earn quite a lot from exporting their cat  if any of you want a copy of the document on alders referred to in the  ecumenical report i have some here you can study it over lunch before we go on to keep theto  to look at the minutes  and   for the young people who were actually on the weekend in  sharing everything on a different  and what i've asked is that they actually did   and not separate it the suggestion had been that in the galleries   so as they come in would you make a statement  and then two minutes  they had  and that one's just next year it makes a lot of difference cos if you've been in a church hall before althoughyou don't   just this table perhaps that's  why we haven't got a group for the next one quite warm again yeah they're doing it by the  oh what we booked the church do you want to see him we got  books here that the trouble oh yes things like bibles yeahthey quite like that there like that no that'll be better got my thick old coati wished i hadn't put it on now haven't got the  i thought it would be here well  yes you know you never these da  i don't even think you know us i know your husbandbut i don't think i've known before i don't know  oh yes you have met me before oh hahave i we met at the  don't you remember oh yesi'd forgotten that bit when you told us about naniel   and a  you know the  yeah name of the shop yes  oh yes it was  may i  and i hope that the young people will join usthey'll feel welcome to  join in any conversation   during this  session of  ofyou know and just one other plan we'd welcome  is the young people in the  come in i think he would welcome you as well stand up i can't remember your surnamei've gotta be honest you really wanna know sorry right very dutch mr bob  is the  minister of  in the united states of america but at the moment serving with the group of churches in ealybathyclyn and also with   erm  part time  working in ealy as the youth worker for the community  working partly for dr barnados  partly for the ult  and methodist  and he'll acting in it as well in ealy and sponsored by the  global  of the united states the obviously we welcome you  the  minutes of the last thing on the and everybody should see who elected presidentalthough some people will have forgottenbut i haven't and  before  any  i ask you whether   there are two additions to these minutes rightthe first addition is  on the last page  under the  erm  the  royal hall of ministers and elders to er  remember their  erm  printed in the  official copy for this  but left off this copy  were the namesalso the reverend    of glangothwyn and the reverend victor   of hamwell erm  does anybody else wish to  make any comments on the minutes of  knowing martin  what  john has just told me about him  if i didn't know him i don't think it would me anything brief details like that are meaningless i trust the ministerial committee  to make decisions and bring recommendations on the other handi would like to meet the candidates to see what they look like but that doesn't apa but what they look like is not going to affect whether i  support the ministerial committee or not what actual details do we give to you despite what david saidthat  yeah rather hurt putting it in thereforewe did read the description yesoh oh actuallyi think david is right i it didn't come overbut for me when we interviewed martin is one of most refreshing interviews  i've had the pleasure of taking part in he's a man of  rare   who was so privileged to go to cambridge  and to be interviewed and came back having learnt a new verse  which was probably written about twenty or thirty years ago  but recognised that his own congregations  would be very suspicious of them and it delights from this  thank you john okay  number two would you please affirm the call of ian   for  in the psychiatric unit no would you of  our counselling  i've been involved in interview with  don't you like my  right yeshe's about  five foot eleven erm  he is a member of vanroch caerphilly  at urc  and has done  i think  he is currently at   and erm  have felt a gentle call emerging over the last  few years  and erm  all started in cambridgethat's about itthat's all i can say oxford oxfordsorry had too much  all in favour of er ian's  call being  affirmed please thank you and thirdlywe ask you to affirm the call of peter   for

ministry within the vale  and brings tremendous  in  erm to the ministry which he  he will hopefully let the side   he is also a self-employed   i thought he'd be touting for business we are not at the time of businesswe are here to affirm the call all in favour please show thank you as we come to end of  of that part  we have erm  burmingford hall of ministry twothree people  and we have also  as part of the report recognised the timing of roy where's roy roywho is sitting over there lastlyrecognise this man is bobwho's sitting over there erm  those two peoplealong with bryn   erm  were also inin college together so they started their ministry off togetherand i think it's  something quite special to me  and to recognise that we  have sent three people off on a journey  and three peopletwo herehave come to the end of a journey and  just part of the journey  and are beginning to discover that  will be  discovered in the life  of the three human beingshuman beings at the time shall we remember  and these three friends in life lord we thank you for the ways in which you challenge and call people  to all forms of ministry within the light of your church and especially we thank you today for the call of martin  and ian  and richard  to the ministry of word and sacrament within the light of your church we pray for them and their families we pray for them in their studies in their pilgrimage to  discover more of your presence in their lives as they begin a particular stage of the ministry  we also pray for those who are coming towards the end of that particular stage of the ministry remember especially bob and roy  and we pray that you will enable them to find fulfilment and enjoymentand enrichment  in their lives as they  step forward  in faith and confidence in  lord in your mercy  amen amen reports are not always about revolutions  and that's important and you will see that we now have  a good  erm   wellover to noel  to relax with each other thoughtsquestionscomments about the life of the ministry of the church and  happens  some people have prepared particular presentationsyou will see after one is on and one of political insubordinationone on the process of learning together five  districts have erm  prepared some of vision  in order to  share that vision or that example of what is happening in the districtsrelating to the ministry  erm  with the   and those who have come to us as well and  one church has prepared a  little presentation or  mind-stretchingheart-stretching thought of church and community so we'rewe're here now to relax to talk about the ministry of office i thinkin starting this offi would like to  encourage as many people to take place in conversationif possible and i will include in that  those who are  younger than most of us here erto talk about what  you think about the ministry  of the church as well we're talking about this  partly because of the document passed in the ministry in whicheverybody has avidly read  and erm  has been  talked about after the seventeenth  erin york  in july but i think the more important reason for talking about  the ministry of the new churchor the ministry of the church  is because of the  erm  developing needs and the  developing thoughts and ideas which are actually  additions  which are thethe crucial area  where ministry takes place first of alli think it would be useful if we were clear  that with the new ministry was a waste too oftenwe are limited in thinking of ministry as those who  either do or do not work where  are thought of andwe might call those ministersif you likewith a big m. erm  but we'll be talking about the ministry of the church we're actually talking abouti meanif you remember this we're talking about  the absinity  of the body of christ that is the ministry of the church but each one that's here  however old or however young  are a part  an active part  an essential part  a crucial part  of the ministry of the body of christ we are these and how we relate  within the church  and how we relate outside the church  althoughin essencethere is nothing outside the church  there is nothing that that position  okay as you look into your shaving mirror in the morningyou shall sayhello ministerhow are you or as you look into your drawer in the morningto find out what you need  to put into your hand bag in the dayyou say hello ministerhow are you okay that's  we're also talking in terms of a ministry  which  what you expect  is very often what you get  you're trained to be somebody okay and one of the things that these trainings help you   is that if you expect something of a child  then you're much more likely to get it that way it's positive if you expect that child is going to  do a fantastic job  on that painting  then that encouragement and confidence is coming across it also works negatively if you don't expect much from little tommy  thenlittle tommy is less and less likely to give you anything much so we're talking about ministry we're talking about something which is bound by our expectations we need to be aware of our expectations  because our expectations can be  limiting  and can be stretching and  inspiring we also are exercising the ministry of the church  within a context we've learnt something about the church and  one of the contexts in which we are exercising ministry is that we have  for the last fifty years  well i haven't personally but for the last fifty years or so  for most of us  the experience of the church  has been declined  and  closer  and  reducing number of people with dog collars okay there have been negative interference we need to be aware  of how those can actually triple the numbers we need to be aware of how  we are  subconsciously  taught a geographer  knows that  and  the whole environment importance a geographer also knows that in order to  use maps  you need to know  where you are you can't get anywhere without knowing where we are half of our exercise in listening to each other is to know where we are in order that we can begin to recognise  the movements and the visions and the views  of where we can be knowing where we are in terms of the way in which we are tricked into having  bad  knowing where we are in the way in which we are tricked  into believing that erm  our churches now are weaker than when they were founded  and  probably most of youmany of you have heard my children's prayer the children are the difference between churches now and churches in the past especially at church anniversaries and nine times out of ten when i ask the congregation  whether your church is bigger now than it was when it was founded  nine times out of ten the congregation sayit is smaller now than when it was founded and nine point nine times out of ten they are wrong we've got a wrong  false  image of the  and that is harmful and it's parallel those visions come from within ourselves come from the way in which we don't necessarily take on board what we are learning they come also from  orgasmic enters or whatever  such programmes there are go around these days caroleyou tell the people sitting next to you what orgasmic is what did he say i don't know  is it derek nimmo in the nineteen fifties i never erm i never watched itin fact there's also the whole of notion of what we are saying by our ministry together okay what we arewhat we are saying by our buildings sort of ended in a little   what we are saying by our notice boards many of which are still in action what we are saying by our commitment or our attitude what we are saying by  the way in which we share what we are saying by our commitment to justice  and peace all of these are involved  and a part of our ministry andthat againmight be me  but many of you when you've heard me say it in a service  i've ended up  with my asking at the end of a sermon  asking the congregation to smile nowyou know that's  how many of you ihave i done that to well thatthat may be a reflection on meokay but  what are we saying by our expressions  both within worship and outside and of courseour discussion of ministry
