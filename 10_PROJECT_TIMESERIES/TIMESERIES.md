# Timeseries Projects
This folder gathers all timeseries-related projects. I broadly classify them into the following sub-domains:
* Cliodynamics
  With broad socio-economic datasets, large social trends should become evident. Since the forecast cannot be based on an extrinsic stance, but must be made intrinsically, i.e.
  any forecast affects the system being forecasted, I judge it unlikely that this projects will yield useful foresight (the argument is derived from Karl Popper's opinions on
  cliodynamics, and his argument against historical determinism). Post-hoc analyses can however provide interesting insights on hostory. 
* Data Completion
  Attempt to construct a network which can learn the characteristics of noisy time series, to complete incomplete data.
* Forecasts
  Data-driven forecasts in general are examined, not necessarily based on any learning methods. Comparison of different methods.
* LSTMs
  Direct time series forecasts using deep-learning methods, especially using LSTMs
* Reinforcement Learning
  Implementation of RL methods. This is classed as time series forecasting because I consider all planned action in the real world as a time series forecasting problem. RL hopefully
  will turn out to be the most powerful predictor.
